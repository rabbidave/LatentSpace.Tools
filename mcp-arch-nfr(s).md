## Non-Functional Requirements

The MCP Handshake Architecture must address several important operational considerations:

### Performance and Latency

- The two-phase handshake introduces additional network round-trips
- Typical latency overhead: 50-200ms depending on implementation
- Recommended optimizations:
  - Keep State Store in same region as Remote MCP Service
  - Use connection pooling for database operations
  - Cache frequently used validation patterns
  - Consider response time SLAs per sensitivity tier

### Scalability

- State Store must scale to handle token volume (typical scaling factor: 10-100x transactions/second)
- Remote MCP Service should be horizontally scalable
- Consider stateless design where possible, with shared state only in dedicated State Store
- Token TTLs should be configured based on expected volume and latency

### Reliability and Availability

- Remote MCP Service should implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- State Store requires high availability configuration (e.g., Redis cluster)
- Consider circuit breakers for Target API calls
- Implement proper timeout handling at all service boundaries

### Auditability and Observability

- All handshake operations must be logged with consistent transaction IDs
- Logs should include request source, operation type, timestamp, and result
- Transaction proofs should be stored durably for compliance requirements
- Implement metrics collection for token usage, validation results, and error rates
- Consider separate audit log storage with immutable properties for compliance

### Security Bootstrapping

- Components establish trust through standard TLS with certificate validation
- API keys and secrets should be rotated regularly
- Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication
- Infrastructure should be deployed in secure VPC with appropriate network controls# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Handshake Architecture
