# AI Security Architecture

##AI Passports

AI security is fundamentally about observability with context. We track inputs, outputs, and model behavior patterns, then compare against established baselines to detect anomalies; logged to a per-integration API with per-deploy specifics and end-to-end configuration details (Yay! SR11-7v2!! Go Governance!!).

## Core Components

### 1. Input/Output Logging
- Track prompts, responses, and processing patterns
- Establish baselines of normal vs. abnormal behavior
- Apply data classification (PICR) for appropriate handling

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring
- Compare current behavior against established patterns
- Alert on deviations that exceed thresholds
- Apply lightweight checks broadly, heavier verification selectively

### 3. Verification & Testing
- Validate models against known attack patterns
- Implement continuous security testing
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

## Role-Based Implementation

Each team has clear responsibilities:
- **Enterprise**: Set security standards, define classifications
- **IT/Ops**: Configure runtime environments, validation parameters
- **Application Teams**: Implement controls, monitor business metrics

## Business Benefits

- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements with audit trails
- **Security**: Detect and mitigate novel AI-specific threats
- **Operational**: Faster incident response with clear accountability

## Getting Started

1. Define your data classification scheme
2. Establish baseline metrics for normal model behavior
3. Implement logging and monitoring with appropriate alerts
4. Create clear response procedures for anomalies
