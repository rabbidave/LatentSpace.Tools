### Secure Front Door: AI Use Case Submission via ServiceNow Portal

Any employee (e.g., "Steve from Accounting") can propose an AI use case through a dedicated catalog item‚Äîfor instance, via a ServiceNow portal form‚Äîwhich acts as a key data capture point within the enterprise's AI Intake Platform. While the portal itself employs standard secure submission protocols, the robust Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) protection for the AI use case's auditable lifecycle is anchored by the **`system_breadcrumb.txt`**. This breadcrumb is a cryptographic hash of the `use_case_registry.json`, which is meticulously compiled from the details submitted through this initial 'Front Door'. Thus, the integrity of the data captured here is paramount, as it directly underpins the non-repudiable audit trail secured by the breadcrumb. The form emphasizes detailing the specific functions/actions within each tool.

### Step 1: Parent Ticket Creation & Initial Triage (ServiceNow Workflow)

1.  **Automated Ticket Creation:** An "AI Use Case Onboarding" ticket (e.g., `AIM_CASE0012345`) is created in ServiceNow, acting as the record within the single intake platform.
2.  **Assignment:** Routed to "AI Governance Team" or "AI Intake Coordinator."
3.  **Initial Review:** The team reviews submitted information, *paying close attention to the declared tool actions and their proposed classifications*. This initial check is critical for flagging high-risk actions early.

---

### Step 2: Structured Information Gathering & Verification (ServiceNow Tasks)

The sub-tasks provide a concrete starting point for verification, potentially drawing on or pushing data to other systems connected to the single intake platform (e.g., a master data management system for data classifications or a GRC tool for compliance checks).

<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Example ServiceNow Sub-Tasks </summary>

*   **Task 1: Use Case Scope & Objective Validation**
    *   **Assigned to:** Business Contact, AI Intake Coordinator.

### Step 3: `use_case_registry.json` Creation & Approval

The `use_case_registry.json` accurately reflects this granular detail. This registry file might be versioned and stored in a central artifact repository, linked from the ServiceNow ticket within the single intake platform.

<details>
<summary><strong>üìÑ Artifact Example: <code>use_case_registry.json</code> (w /Tool Actions)</strong></summary>

      ]
    }
    // ... other tools and their specific actions ...
  ],
  // ... stakeholders, attestations_log_link etc. ...
}
```

</details>

1.  **Attachment & Approval Workflow:** The detailed `use_case_registry.json` is attached to the ServiceNow ticket and routed for approval. Approvers have a clear view of the specific operations and their individual risk profiles.
2.  **Version Control Integration:** Recommended for the `use_case_registry.json`.

### Step 4: `system_breadcrumb.txt` Generation & Logging Control

The `use_case_registry.json` is hashed with all the detailed and accurate information regarding specific tool actions. The consistent and accurate inclusion of this `system_breadcrumb_id` in all relevant operational logs (e.g., `tool_invocation.log`) is a critical control. Model Risk Management (MRM) / 2nd Line of Defense teams will have oversight responsibilities to periodically validate the presence and integrity of these breadcrumbs in log streams as part of their monitoring duties, ensuring that the audit trail remains anchored and trustworthy.

<details>
<summary><strong>üçû Artifact Example: <code>system_breadcrumb.txt</code></strong></summary>

```text

```
*(Example hash based on `use_case_registry.json`)*.

### Step 5: Operationalizing, Logging, & MRM/2nd Line Monitoring and Audit Oversight

Operational logs are generated by the system during tool invocations, providing detailed records of AI actions. While these logs are essential for operational troubleshooting and security incident response by operational teams, the Model Risk Management (MRM) / 2nd Line of Defense assumes specific ongoing monitoring and audit oversight responsibilities. These responsibilities are often managed as distinct sub-tasks within the AI Governance framework after deployment, focusing on the integrity of the control framework and model performance rather than individual transaction reviews.

<details>
<summary><strong>üìú Artifact Example: <code>tool_invocation.log</code> ( i.e. System Actions)</strong></summary>

The `tool.name` field in the MCP Handshake log clearly identifies the *specific action* that was invoked. The `system_breadcrumb_id` links this specific invocation back to its approved configuration.

```json
{
  "log_entry_id": "log-uuid-...",
  "system_breadcrumb_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
  "mcp_handshake_schema": "MCP.Handshake.v1",
  "transaction": { /* ... */ },
  "tool": {
    "name": "VendorPay_API-v1.5/initiateSinglePayment", // Tool_System_ID + Action_Name from registry
    "version": "1.5.2", // Actual version of the API endpoint/function called
    "sensitivity": "Class1_PII", // Verified classification of THIS SPECIFIC ACTION
    "parameters_hash": "sha256-of-actual-parameters-for-initiateSinglePayment...",
    "target_api": {
      "name": "VendorPay Payment Initiation API", // Corresponds to tool_system_name
      "operation": "POST /v1/payments" // Corresponds to target_api_endpoint_details
    }
  },
  "authentication": { /* ... Ephemeral token bound to this specific action and its params ... */ },
  "validation": {
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "checks_performed": [ /* MCP Handshake checks relevant to Class1_PII actions */
      "dual_agent_confirmation_received"
    ],
    "tier_level_applied": "Class1_PII" // Validation tier applied for this action
  },
  "audit": {
    "integration_id": "ACC-EXP-001_VendorPay_initiateSinglePayment", // More specific integration point
    /* ... */
  },
  /* ... execution_result, error_handling ... */
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>üîç MRM/2nd Line Ongoing Monitoring & Audit Sub-Tasks</summary>

*   **System Breadcrumb Validation:**
    *   Periodically audit operational logs (e.g., samples from `tool_invocation.log` streams or aggregated logging platforms) to confirm the consistent presence and correctness of the `system_breadcrumb_id`.
    *   Verify that the `system_breadcrumb_id` in logs matches the officially registered breadcrumb for the deployed AI use case.
*   **Model Performance Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics of the AI model against the baselines and thresholds defined in the `use_case_registry.json`.
    *   Review model drift, accuracy, fairness, and other relevant performance characteristics over time.
    *   Validate that model behavior remains within acceptable parameters and aligns with its intended purpose and risk profile.
*   **Compliance & Control Adherence:**
    *   Assess adherence to the data classifications and MCP Handshake security extensions specified for each tool action in the `use_case_registry.json` through sampled log reviews or automated checks.
    *   Review access patterns and aggregated tool invocation frequencies for anomalies or deviations from expected behavior defined in the AI Passport.
    *   Ensure that logging mechanisms themselves are functioning correctly and haven't been tampered with.
*   **Issue Escalation & Reporting:**
    *   Report findings, deviations, and risks to relevant stakeholders, including AI Governance, business owners, and IT/Operations.
    *   Track remediation of any identified issues related to model performance, control failures, or audit discrepancies.
