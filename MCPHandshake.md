# Handshake MCP Architecture

A secure integration pattern for connecting AI assistants with sensitive operations through coordinated, transaction-specific authentication protocols.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Coordinated Components

This architecture consists of two primary components that work through a secure handshake mechanism:

- **Local MCP Server**: Deployed on the user's device or local environment; responsible for initiating transaction requests.
- **Remote MCP Service**: Serverless function or dormant/hibernated service that awaits handshake signals to execute sensitive operations.

These components establish trust through a cryptographically verified handshake protocol while maintaining independent security contexts. User authentication (establishing user identity to the Remote Service) may precede the transaction-specific handshake.

### 2. Just-in-Time Resource Allocation

Resources are allocated only when needed for a specific transaction:

- Remote services remain dormant or scale to zero when inactive.
- New, isolated instances can be spawned for each operation or handshake phase.
- Compute resources are consumed ephemerally, aligning cost with activity.

### 3. Transaction-Bound Ephemeral Auth

Each sensitive operation requires a distinct, two-phase handshake explicitly bound to that specific transaction instance:

- **Phase 1: Authorization Request**: The authenticated user requests authorization for a specific target operation with defined parameters.
- **Phase 2: Ephemeral Token Grant & Consumption**: Upon successful authorization, a unique, single-use Ephemeral Transaction Token (e.g., a nonce or short-lived capability token) is generated and returned. This token is:
  - Tied cryptographically (e.g., via state store reference and parameter hashing) to the specific transaction UUID, authorized user, target operation, and parameters.
  - Limited in scope strictly to the single authorized business operation instance.
  - Given a very short expiration period (e.g., seconds), sufficient only to be immediately used in the subsequent operation call.
  - Managed via a secure state store (e.g., KV store, cache) where its validity (pending status) is tracked.

**Token Consumption**: The Ephemeral Transaction Token is presented alongside the operation request and is atomically consumed (e.g., state marked used or deleted) upon successful validation before the sensitive operation executes, preventing replay.

Verification receipts confirm the token's lifecycle (issuance, consumption, or expiration).

## Operational Flow

### Initialization:
1. User activates the local MCP client/server.
2. User authenticates to the Remote MCP Service via standard OAuth/JWT flows, obtaining a primary Session Token.
3. Local client prepares for transaction-specific handshakes. (User may provide public key material during this phase for verification purposes).

### Transaction Binding & Authorization Request:
1. AI assistant initiates a transaction (e.g., "Create invoice for X"), potentially including a sensitivity/data classification tag.
2. Local client identifies the target tool (e.g., create[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/community/blog/paypal-model-context-protocol/)Invoice) and parameters, determining the required authentication flow based on tool metadata or sensitivity tag.
3. If the two-phase handshake is required: Local client sends an Authorization Request call to a dedicated endpoint on the Remote MCP Service, passing the target tool, parameters, and the user's Session Token.
4. Remote service validates the Session Token, generates a unique transactionId, hashes parameters, and checks user permissions for the requested operation.

### Ephemeral Token Grant (Handshake Phase 1 Complete):
1. Remote service generates a unique, single-use Ephemeral Transaction Token (nonce).
2. Remote service stores the transaction state (transactionId, userId, targetTool, paramsHash, status: pending, short expiry) in a secure state store (e.g., KV), keyed by the Ephemeral Transaction Token.
3. Remote service returns the transactionId and the Ephemeral Transaction Token to the Local client.

### Operation Execution (Handshake Phase 2):
1. Local client immediately constructs the actual operation request (e.g., call create[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/community/blog/paypal-model-context-protocol/)Invoice tool).
2. Local client sends the operation request to the Remote MCP Service, passing:
   - The user's Session Token (e.g., Authorization: Bearer ...).
   - The Ephemeral Transaction Token (e.g., X-Transaction-Authorization: ... header).
   - The required operation parameters.
3. Remote service validates the Session Token again.
4. Remote service retrieves the transaction state from the store using the Ephemeral Transaction Token.
5. Crucially: The service atomically consumes the token (e.g., deletes the state entry) and validates its expiry, user, tool, and parameter hash against the current request.

### Sensitive Operation & Proof Generation:
1. If ephemeral token validation succeeds, the Remote MCP Service executes the sensitive operation (e.g., calls [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/community/blog/paypal-model-context-protocol/) API) using the validated transactionId for idempotency.
2. Cryptographic proofs (receipts) are generated, bound to the transactionId. Proofs may be digitally signed by the Remote Service.
3. Results and the complete proof chain are returned securely to the Local client.
4. Local client validates the cryptographic receipts (e.g., verifying signatures using pre-registered user public keys or service public keys).

### Handshake Termination:
1. The Ephemeral Transaction Token is already invalidated/consumed (Step 4). Timed-out tokens expire naturally via TTL in the state store.
2. Operation receipt and audit logs (including transactionId) are persisted.
3. Remote service instance may return to hibernation.
4. Secure connection related to the specific operation call is closed.

## Cryptographic Receipts and Proofs

The architecture employs several cryptographic techniques to create verifiable, tamper-proof evidence of transactions:

### Non-Repudiation Implementation
- **Digital Signatures**: Where required by sensitivity policy, transaction-specific digital signatures are created. Receipts signed by the Remote Service can be verified by the Local Client; requests signed by the Local Client (using user-provided keys) can be verified by the Remote Service, proving origin and integrity.
- **Cryptographic Hash Chains**: Each logical step within the Remote Service's execution may create a hash including the previous step's hash, forming evidence of sequence.
- **Timestamped Merkle Proofs**: Transaction details can optionally be inserted into Merkle trees with trusted timestamps to prove action timing.
- **Transaction Binding**: All proofs are cryptographically bound to the specific transaction UUID (transactionId) using collision-resistant hashing.

### Guarantees Provided
- **Origin Authentication**: Cryptographic proof of which user/client initiated the transaction (via session token and potentially client-side signatures). Proof of service execution via service-side signatures.
- **Receipt Verification**: Proof that the recipient received the specific message or transaction result, verifiable via digital signatures if implemented.
- **Sequence Validation**: Cryptographic evidence of the order of operations within the transaction context (via hash chains if implemented).
- **Integrity Protection**: Tamper-evident seals (hashes, signatures) make modification to transaction data detectable.
- **Temporal Proof**: Cryptographically verifiable evidence of when steps occurred (via signed timestamps or Merkle proofs).

## Security Benefits

### Zero Standing Privileges
- No long-lived tokens grant direct access to sensitive operations.
- The user's Session Token only grants the privilege to request a transaction authorization, not execute it.
- The Ephemeral Transaction Token grants privilege only for the specifically authorized operation instance, is single-use, time-bound (seconds), and immediately consumed/destroyed upon validation.
- Principle of least privilege is enforced dynamically at the transaction level via the ephemeral token mechanism.

### Isolated Contexts
- Each handshake establishes an isolated security context for the specific transaction.
- Compromise of one session token does not automatically grant execution rights; compromise of an ephemeral token affects only one inflight transaction.
- Clear security boundaries between handshake participants and phases.

### Reduced Attack Surface
- Sensitive components only execute logic after successful validation of both session and ephemeral tokens.
- Minimal network exposure of critical services; ephemeral tokens reduce the window for credential misuse.
- Defense-in-depth through layered authentication (session + transaction).

### Enhanced Audit Trail
- Distinct transactionId for each authorized operation attempt.
- Clear tracking of authorization requests, ephemeral token issuance, consumption attempts (success/failure), and final operation execution.
- Detailed logs associate user identity, client, requested operation, parameters (hashed), and timing for each step.

## Implementation Considerations

### Metadata-Driven Policy Enforcement
- Sensitivity tags or classifications (provided by the initiating agent or inherent to the tool) guide the required authentication flow and cryptographic rigor. Implementations must parse this metadata to determine if the two-phase handshake and/or specific signature requirements apply.
- Differential requirements (e.g., stricter validation, mandatory signatures) enforced based on this sensitivity level.
- User public keys may be pre-registered for workflows demanding client-side signatures or specific receipt verification capabilities.
- Cryptographic enforcement (parameter hashing, token consumption, signature validation) is integral to policy implementation.

### Conditional Logic Implementation
Remote MCP Service requires logic to:
- Validate session tokens.
- Determine required auth flow based on tool metadata/sensitivity.
- Authorize requests based on user permissions and target tool.
- Generate and store ephemeral token state (if required).
- Atomically validate and consume ephemeral tokens, including parameter hash checks (if required).
- Conditionally execute backend operations.
- Generate appropriate cryptographic receipts (potentially signed).

Complexity managed through clear separation of concerns (session auth vs. transaction auth vs. execution).

### Hibernation Management
- Optimal hibernation policies based on usage patterns (relevant for non-serverless deployments).
- Cold start latency primarily impacts the initial session validation or authorization request. The short lifetime of the ephemeral token necessitates low latency between authorization and execution calls.
- State (pending ephemeral tokens) preserved reliably in the external state store (e.g., KV).

### Transaction-Bound Token Lifecycle
- A two-phase protocol (authorize->execute) manages the lifecycle when required by policy.
- Ephemeral Transaction Tokens are typically nonces or opaque strings whose state is managed server-side (e.g., in KV).
- State must include bindings to transactionId, userId, targetTool, paramsHash, and a short expiry.
- Atomic Consumption (e.g., KV delete checked against prior existence) upon validation is the primary revocation mechanism, preventing replays. KV TTL handles expiry.
- Parameter hashing ensures the token cannot be reused for the same tool with different inputs.
- Tokens are inherently non-transferable and single-operation scoped by the validation logic.

## Advantages Over Traditional Integrations

- **Superior Security Isolation**: Strong separation between user session authentication and fine-grained, single-use transaction execution authorization.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Serverless/hibernating remote services consume resources only during active authorization or execution phases.
- **Compliance Advantages**: Clear, auditable trail demonstrating explicit, parameter-bound authorization for every sensitive operation via the ephemeral token lifecycle.
- **Flexible Provider Integration**: Works with standard identity providers (OAuth/JWT) for session management while layering transaction-specific controls.
- **Minimal Persistent Attack Surface**: Reduces risk by eliminating standing privileges and ensuring execution tokens are single-use and time-limited to seconds.

## Acknowledgements & Implementation Considerations

The Handshake MCP architecture is designed to provide a high degree of security for sensitive operations, particularly when initiated via less trusted environments like AI assistants. It achieves this through core principles like Zero Standing Privileges and Transaction-Bound Ephemeral Authentication.

Users and implementers should acknowledge the following design aspects and considerations:

### 1. Security as a Deliberate Trade-off

#### Latency
The multi-step handshake protocol (Session Auth → Authorize Transaction → Execute with Ephemeral Token) inherently introduces more network roundtrips compared to simpler, single-call API patterns. This potential increase in latency is a deliberate trade-off, accepted to gain the significant security benefits of ephemeral, transaction-specific authorization. For high-risk operations like payments, this added security often outweighs concerns over minor latency increases, aligning with patterns already common in robust financial systems.

#### Implementation Overhead
Implementing the two-phase handshake, state management for ephemeral tokens (e.g., using KV stores), parameter hashing, and atomic token consumption introduces complexity beyond basic API token validation. This overhead is considered proportional to the risks being mitigated, especially in regulated environments or where the cost of compromise is high. The pattern necessitates careful engineering.

### 2. Key Areas Requiring Careful Implementation

#### Robust Error Handling
The architecture pattern defines the successful authorization path. Implementations must build comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios:
- Network errors during any phase
- Failures in the underlying sensitive service (e.g., PayPal API errors after authorization)
- Ephemeral token expiry before use
- State store unavailability
- Validation failures

Compensation logic for failed transactions post-authorization is an application-level responsibility built upon the pattern's foundation.

#### Observability & Debuggability
The ephemeral nature of the transaction tokens can make debugging challenging. Implementations must include comprehensive logging and distributed tracing capabilities. Every step of the handshake (session validation, authorization request, token generation, token validation/consumption, final execution attempt) should be logged with the unique transactionId as a core correlation identifier.

#### Key Management
Secure management of signing keys (e.g., for session JWTs) and potentially keys for signing cryptographic receipts is crucial. While essential, this is a standard requirement for any cryptographically secured system and implementers must follow established best practices.

### 3. Strengths & Alignment with Best Practices

Despite the considerations above, the pattern offers significant advantages, particularly for sensitive domains:

#### Reduced Credential Persistence
The ephemeral, single-use nature of the transaction token dramatically limits the persistence and exposure of sensitive execution credentials, strongly aligning with security standards like PCI-DSS.

#### Strong AuthN/AuthZ Separation
It enforces a clear distinction between authenticating the user (session token) and authorizing a specific action (ephemeral token), a recognized security best practice.

#### Enhanced Audit & Non-Repudiation
The detailed lifecycle tracking of the ephemeral token, tied to the transactionId and user identity, provides a powerful audit trail valuable for reconciliation, dispute resolution, and demonstrating compliance.

---

**In summary**: The Handshake MCP architecture provides a strong foundation for building highly secure integrations. Its security benefits are achieved through specific design choices that require diligent implementation, particularly around error handling, observability, and state management. Implementers should view these not as weaknesses, but as necessary engineering requirements to realize the full security potential of the pattern.
