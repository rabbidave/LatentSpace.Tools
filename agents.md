# 🚂🤖🪄[Conductor](https://github.com/rabbidave/conductor)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

* Deployable interface (GUI/API) that (locally) orchestrates multiple (remote and/or local) Language Models.

* Python code is executed and tested against assertions; via configurable allow/block list of operations (regex).

## Features

*   **Multi LM Interaction:** Engage with multiple LMs sequentially for mob-style programming.
*   **Safe Code Execution:** Run Python Code within a sandboxed environment via allowed/restricted operations.
*   **Automated Test Assertions:** Define test cases using `TEST-ASSERT` blocks; Conductor runs them automatically.
*   **Test-Driven Generation:** Generation stops after a configurable number of successful test passes, encouraging test-driven development.
*   **Customizable System Message:** Tailor the behavior of the LMs by modifying the system message.
*   **Configurable Model IDs:** Easily switch between different local LLMs by updating the model IDs.
*  **Configurable API/Model**: You can use an `.env` file in order to specify the API url and the model id to use.


## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.7+:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a newer version installed.
*   **LM Studio (or similar):** A local LLM server like LM Studio is required. You can download it from [LM Studio's website](https://lmstudio.ai/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rabbidave/conductor
    cd conductor
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install `gradio`, and `openai`.

## Configuration

1.  **LM Studio Setup:**

    *   Launch LM Studio.
    *   Download and load the models you want to use (e.g., `exaone-3.5-32b-instruct@q4_k_m` and `qwq-32b-preview`).
    *   Start the local server in LM Studio (default: `http://localhost:1234`).

2.  **Model IDs:**
    * On the first use of the project, the system will automatically create an `.env` file with the default values. You can modify this file to change the local server url and model ids.
    *   Locate the `.env` file in the project root folder.
    *   Update the model ids `MODEL_A_ID` and `MODEL_B_ID` variables with the correct model IDs from LM Studio.

    ```
    MODEL_A_ID="your-model-a-id"  # e.g., "exaone-3.5-32b-instruct@q4_k_m"
    MODEL_B_ID="your-model-b-id"  # e.g., "qwq-32b-preview"
     LOCAL_API_URL="http://localhost:1234/v1/"
    ```
3.  **System Message (Optional):**

    *   In `LLMManager.__init__`, you can customize the `self.system_message` to modify the behavior of the LLMs. This message sets the context for the conversation and defines the `RUN-CODE` and `TEST-ASSERT` block formats.

    ```python
    self.system_message = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": """You are an AI assistant with Python code execution capabilities.

    1. For code execution, use:
    RUN-CODE
    ```python
    your_code_here
    ```

    2. For tests, use:
    TEST-ASSERT
    ```python
    assert condition, "Test message"
    ```

    3. Important rules:
    - Each block must start with its marker on its own line
    - Code must be within triple backticks with 'python' specified
    - Tests have access to variables from code execution
    - Generation stops after 2 successful test passes

        ... (rest of the system message)
        """
        }
        ```
    
4.  **Test Pass Count:**

    *   To change the number of successful test passes required to stop generation, modify `self.max_passed_tests` in `LLMManager.__init__` in the main python file.

5.  **Logging:**

    *   Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory.
    *   Adjust the logging level in `gradio-llm-interface.py` using:

    ```python
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # For verbose logging
    # or
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)   # For less verbose logging
    ```
    *   Debug level logging can be enabled to provide very detailed output on the behaviour of the code.

6. **Security Note**
 * Always use caution with code generated by an LLM and do not execute code from untrusted sources.

## Usage

1. **Start the Interface:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the UI:**

    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:31337` (or the address indicated in the terminal).

3. **Interact with the LMs:**

    *   Enter your prompt in the "Input Message" textbox.
    *   Click "Submit" to send the message to Model A.
    *   The conversation and results will appear in the "Conversation & Results" textbox.
    *   Code execution and test results will also be displayed.
    *   If the required number of tests pass, generation will stop. Otherwise, Model B will be engaged.
    *   Click "Stop Generation" to manually stop the generation process.
    *   Click "Clear Conversation" to start a new conversation.


## Example Workflow

1. **Prompt:**

    ```
    Write a Python function to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. Include tests to validate the results for n=0, n=1, n=5, and n=10.
    ```

2. **Model A's Response (may vary):**

    ```
    RUN-CODE
    ```python
    def fibonacci_recursive(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
    ```

    TEST-ASSERT
    ```python
    assert fibonacci_recursive(0) == 0, "fibonacci_recursive(0) should be 0"
    assert fibonacci_recursive(1) == 1, "fibonacci_recursive(1) should be 1"
    assert fibonacci_recursive(5) == 5, "fibonacci_recursive(5) should be 5"
    assert fibonacci_recursive(10) == 55, "fibonacci_recursive(10) should be 55"
    ```
    ```

3. **Execution and Testing:**

    *   Conductor will execute the `RUN-CODE` block.
    *   It will then run the `TEST-ASSERT` block.
    *   The results (output and test outcomes) will be displayed.
    *   The output in the UI will include the footer:

        ```
        Code block 1 output:

        ---
        Have fun y'all! 🤠🪄🤖
        ```

## Troubleshooting

*   **Package Installation Errors:** If you encounter errors during package installation, ensure your virtual environment is activated, and you have the necessary permissions to install packages.
*   **LM Studio Connection Issues:** Verify that LM Studio is running and the local server is started. Check the port number (default: 1234) and make sure it matches the `base_url` in `LLMManager.__init__` or in the `.env` file.
*   **Model Not Found:** Double-check that the model IDs you've configured in  the `.env` file are correct and that the models are loaded in LM Studio.
*   **Git Errors:** If you get errors related to Git, make sure Git is installed and that the project is inside a Git repository. If you don't want to use Git, the code will fall back to skipping diff generation.
