# Handshake MCP Architecture

A secure integration pattern for connecting AI assistants with sensitive operations through coordinated, transaction-specific authentication protocols.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Coordinated Components

This architecture consists of two primary components that work through a secure handshake mechanism:

- **Local MCP Server**: Deployed on the user's device or local environment
- **Remote MCP Service**: Dormant/hibernated service that awaits handshake signals

These components establish trust through a cryptographically verified handshake protocol while maintaining independent security contexts.

### 2. Just-in-Time Resource Allocation

Resources are allocated only when needed:

- Remote services remain dormant (hibernated) when not in use
- New instances can be spawned for each operation, providing isolation
- Compute resources scale to zero when inactive, reducing costs

### 3. Transaction-Bound Ephemeral Auth

Each interaction establishes a distinct handshake bound to specific transactions:

- Fresh OAuth tokens generated with unique UUIDs tied to specific operations (e.g., invoice #AB12345)
- Tokens limited in scope to exactly one business transaction identifier
- Cryptographically bound to transaction metadata with short expiration periods
- Tokens destroyed immediately after operation completion with verification receipts

## Operational Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - User activates the local MCP server
   - The local server authenticates the user through standard OAuth flows
   - Local server prepares for handshake with the remote environment

2. **Transaction Binding**:
   - AI assistant initiates a transaction with specific business identifier (e.g., Invoice #AB12345)
   - System generates a UUID for the operation that's cryptographically tied to the transaction ID
   - Local MCP server validates the request against authorization policies

3. **Handshake Protocol**:
   - Local server initiates handshake with the dormant remote service using the transaction UUID
   - Remote service either awakens from hibernation or a new instance is deployed
   - Transaction-specific ephemeral tokens are exchanged during the handshake

4. **Operation Execution**:
   - Remote service executes the sensitive operation using invoice-bound credentials
   - Each step in the transaction generates cryptographic proofs (see Cryptographic Receipts section)
   - Results and complete proof chain are returned through secure channel
   - Local server validates the cryptographic receipts before presenting results

5. **Handshake Termination**:
   - Transaction-specific tokens are invalidated with cryptographic verification
   - Operation receipt and audit logs are persisted with the transaction UUID
   - Remote service returns to hibernation (or instance is terminated)
   - Secure connection is closed, completing the handshake lifecycle

## Cryptographic Receipts and Proofs

The architecture employs several cryptographic techniques to create verifiable, tamper-proof evidence of transactions:

### Non-Repudiation Implementation

- **Digital Signatures**: Transaction-specific digital signatures using the recipient's public key are created for each operation, providing proof of both origin and integrity of data
- **Cryptographic Hash Chains**: Each step of the transaction creates a hash that includes the previous step's hash, forming an unbreakable chain of evidence
- **Timestamped Merkle Proofs**: Transaction details are inserted into Merkle trees with trusted timestamps to prove exactly when each action occurred
- **Transaction Binding**: All proofs are cryptographically bound to the specific invoice/transaction UUID using collision-resistant hashing

### Guarantees Provided

- **Origin Authentication**: Cryptographic proof of which entity initiated the transaction
- **Receipt Verification**: Proof that the recipient received the specific message or transaction
- **Sequence Validation**: Cryptographic evidence of the exact order of operations
- **Integrity Protection**: Tamper-evident seals that make any modification to the transaction data detectable
- **Temporal Proof**: Cryptographically verifiable evidence of when each step occurred

## Security Benefits

### Zero Standing Privileges

- No long-lived access tokens
- Credentials only active during specific operations
- Principle of least privilege strictly enforced

### Isolated Contexts

- Each handshake establishes an isolated security context
- Compromise of one session doesn't affect others
- Clear security boundaries between handshake participants

### Reduced Attack Surface

- Sensitive components only exposed during active handshakes
- Minimal network exposure of critical services
- Defense-in-depth through layered architecture

### Enhanced Audit Trail

- Distinct handshake sessions for each operation
- Clear tracking of when services are activated
- Detailed logs of each ephemeral authentication

## Implementation Considerations

### Sensitivity Policy Management

- Clear definition and secure management of sensitivity tags assigned by the Local MCP
- Differential cryptographic requirements based on sensitivity level (e.g., "confidential" or higher requiring specific public key signatures)
- Pre-registration of users with appropriate key material based on access requirements
- Cryptographic enforcement of sensitivity policies through the handshake protocol

### Conditional Logic Implementation

- Remote and Local MCP components require logic to conditionally generate and validate proofs based on sensitivity tags
- Transaction validation rules vary by data classification and operation type
- Handshake protocol distributes policy enforcement across components for resilience
- Complexity management through clear separation of validation responsibilities

### Hibernation Management

- Optimal hibernation policies based on usage patterns
- Cold start latency mitigation strategies
- State preservation during hibernation periods

### Transaction-Bound Token Lifecycle

- Tokens cryptographically bound to specific invoice/transaction UUIDs
- Token scope limited to exactly one business operation (e.g., "process payment for invoice #AB12345")
- Automated token revocation with cryptographic proof of completion
- Non-transferable between operations, even for the same user/session
- Dual invalidation channels to ensure tokens cannot persist

## Advantages Over Traditional Integrations

1. **Superior Security Isolation**: Complete separation of concerns between user-facing components and sensitive operations

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Resources only consumed during active handshake operations

3. **Compliance Advantages**: Clear demonstration of security controls for auditors

4. **Flexible Provider Integration**: Works with any service supporting OAuth-based authentication

5. **Minimal Persistent Attack Surface**: Critical components only exposed during active handshake sessions
