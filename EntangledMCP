# Entangled MCP Architecture

A secure integration pattern for connecting AI assistants with sensitive operations through ephemeral, isolated authentication contexts.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Entangled Components

This architecture consists of two primary components that work in tandem:

- **Local MCP Server**: Deployed on the user's device or local environment
- **Remote MCP Service**: Dormant/hibernated service that awakens on demand

These components are "entangled" in that they maintain a secure relationship while operating independently, with different security contexts.

### 2. Just-in-Time Resource Allocation

Resources are allocated only when needed:

- Remote services remain dormant (hibernated) when not in use
- New instances can be spawned for each operation, providing isolation
- Compute resources scale to zero when inactive, reducing costs

### 3. Transaction-Bound Ephemeral Auth

Each interaction receives its own authentication context bound to specific transactions:

- Fresh OAuth tokens generated with unique UUIDs tied to specific operations (e.g., invoice #AB12345)
- Tokens limited in scope to exactly one business transaction identifier
- Cryptographically bound to transaction metadata with short expiration periods
- Tokens destroyed immediately after operation completion with verification receipts

## Operational Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - User activates the local MCP server
   - The local server authenticates the user through standard OAuth flows
   - Local server establishes a secure connection to the remote environment

2. **Transaction Binding**:
   - AI assistant initiates a transaction with specific business identifier (e.g., Invoice #AB12345)
   - System generates a UUID for the operation that's cryptographically tied to the transaction ID
   - Local MCP server validates the request against authorization policies

3. **Remote Activation**:
   - Local server sends a "wake" signal to the dormant remote service with the transaction UUID
   - Remote service either awakens from hibernation or a new instance is deployed
   - Transaction-specific ephemeral tokens are generated with the UUID embedded

4. **Operation Execution**:
   - Remote service executes the sensitive operation using invoice-bound credentials
   - Cryptographic receipts generated at each step of the operation
   - Results are returned through the secure channel with verification proofs
   - Local server validates the receipt chain before presenting results

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Transaction-specific tokens are invalidated with cryptographic verification
   - Operation receipt and audit logs are persisted with the transaction UUID
   - Remote service returns to hibernation (or instance is terminated)
   - Secure connection is closed

## Security Benefits

### Zero Standing Privileges

- No long-lived access tokens
- Credentials only active during specific operations
- Principle of least privilege strictly enforced

### Isolated Contexts

- Each operation exists in its own security context
- Compromise of one session doesn't affect others
- Clear security boundaries between components

### Reduced Attack Surface

- Sensitive components only exposed when needed
- Minimal network exposure of critical services
- Defense-in-depth through layered architecture

### Enhanced Audit Trail

- Distinct sessions for each operation
- Clear tracking of when services are activated
- Detailed logs of each ephemeral authentication

## Implementation Considerations

### Hibernation Management

- Optimal hibernation policies based on usage patterns
- Cold start latency mitigation strategies
- State preservation during hibernation periods

### Transaction-Bound Token Lifecycle

- Tokens cryptographically bound to specific invoice/transaction UUIDs
- Token scope limited to exactly one business operation (e.g., "process payment for invoice #AB12345")
- Automated token revocation with cryptographic proof of completion
- Non-transferable between operations, even for the same user/session
- Dual invalidation channels to ensure tokens cannot persist



## Advantages Over Traditional Integrations

1. **Superior Security Isolation**: Complete separation of concerns between user-facing components and sensitive operations

2. **Cost Efficiency**: Resources only consumed during active operations

3. **Compliance Advantages**: Clear demonstration of security controls for auditors

4. **Flexible Provider Integration**: Works with any service supporting OAuth-based authentication

5. **Minimal Persistent Attack Surface**: Critical components only exposed when actively in use
